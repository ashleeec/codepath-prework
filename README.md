## App Brainstorming
 3-5 applications and 2-3 features per app
 Beli
    - being able to see friend's recently dined at restaurants
    - having the list of restaurants i've eaten at categorized by city
    
Duolingo
    - fun animations for extending your streak
    - app icon changes every so often
    
Slack
    - custom notification sound
    - being able to snooze notifications based on time of day
 
 app idea: I want to build an app that helps with panic attacks by initiating a breathing sequence. In the future, I'd like to connect it with apple watch data to be able to track heart rate and metrics while a panic attack is happening. Finally, the app is whale themed and really cute.
